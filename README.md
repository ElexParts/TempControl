# Temperature Controller

In this project, I'm trying to learn about Arduino by building a Temperature Controller using a DHT11 Temperature Sensor. The read temperature will be displayed on a 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display.

Check tutorial for this project at https://www.elexlabs.com .

## BOM List

* Arduino Uno Rev3
* DHT11 Temperature Sensor
* 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display
* 330 ohm resistor
* 10K potentiometer
* 12V power supply adaptor
* jumper wires

## Compiling and Uploading

For this project, I wasn't using the Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading the source code, instead, I'm using [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide).

Why PlatformIO? That is because I prefer a proper IDE that has syntax highlighting and that I also want to manage a custom library within this project.
