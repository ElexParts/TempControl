# Temperature Controller

In this project, I'm trying to learn about Arduino by building a Temperature Controller using a DHT11 Temperature Sensor. The read temperature will be displayed to 4-Digit Common Anode 7-Segment Display.

## Bom List

* Arduino Uno Rev3
* DHT11 Temperature Sensor
* 4-Digit Common Anode 7-Segment Display
* BC557 x2
* 180 ohm resistor x12
* 12V power supply adaptor
* jumper wires
* ribbon cable

## Compiling and Uploading

For this project, I wasn't using the Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading the source code, instead, I'm using [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide).

Why PlatformIO? That is because I prefer a proper IDE that has syntax highlighting and that I also want to manage a custom library within this project.
